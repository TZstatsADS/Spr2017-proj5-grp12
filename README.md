+ Project summary: Since social media permeates every aspect of today's world, we thought it particularly relevant and interesting to pursue something in that vein. So, in this project we aim to explore the ways in which Twitter can provide us insights into questions we may have on a wide range of topics. What do people talk about? And how do they talk about them? Pertaining to our exploratory analysis, we chose to focus on the currently ongoing 2017 NBA playoffs. We wish to answer questions about the fan base peak tweet time, sentiment analysis for before and after the game, etc. Essentially, what data can we gather from tweets and what can that data tell us? Along the way we explored the nature of the data provided by twitter along with its constraints and limitations. For the sake of brevity and cleanliness, we decided to focus on two major playoff teams - the Cleveland Caveliers and the Golden State Warriors - as an example of the greater possibilities of data mining data and meta data from Twitter.
