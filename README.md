+ Project summary: In this project we aim to explore ways that twitter can provide us insights to questions we may have on a wide range of topics. The topic we chose for this project is the NBA playoffs. We wish to answer questions about the fan base  peak tweet time, sentiment analysis for before and after the game, etc. ALong the way we explore nature of the data provided by twitter along with its constraints the limitations, For the sake of brevity and cleaness, we decided to focus on two play off teams in particular, the Cleveland Caveliers and the Golden State Warriors.
